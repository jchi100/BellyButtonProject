# BellyButtonProject

The project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).
Pythonâ€™s Flask and SQLAlchemy are used to serve data for the Javascript functions on the HTML dashboard pages. Data source are Belly Button Batch2_OTU and Metadata_17Nov14.xlsx, which are converted to belly_button_biodiversity.sqlite with Python Jupiter Notebook.  Plotly.js is for building interactive charts for your dashboard.
